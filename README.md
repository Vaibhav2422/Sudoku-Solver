# Sudoku Solver in Assembly Language with Web Frontend

This project implements a Sudoku puzzle solver using x86-64 assembly language for Windows, with an added web-based frontend interface. The solver uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to find solutions for 9x9 Sudoku puzzles, and the frontend provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the solver.

## 🎯 Features

- **Recursive Backtracking Algorithm**: Efficiently solves Sudoku puzzles using proven algorithm
- **Multiple Puzzle Support**: Can solve multiple puzzles in a single run
- **Formatted Output**: Displays solved puzzles with grid separators for better visualization
- **Complete Implementation**: Includes all necessary functions for solving Sudoku puzzles
- **Cross-Platform Build Scripts**: Batch files for easy building and running on Windows
- **Web-Based Frontend**: Interactive HTML interface for puzzle input and solution display

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Assembly Implementation

The solver implements the following key functions in x86-64 assembly:
1. `solve()`: Main recursive function that implements backtracking
2. `find_empty()`: Locates the next empty cell in the puzzle
3. `is_valid()`: Checks if a number can be placed in a cell without violating Sudoku rules
4. `print_board_formatted()`: Displays the puzzle with grid separators
5. `print_board()`: Displays the puzzle in simple format

### Sudoku Rules Enforcement

The `is_valid` function ensures that each number placement follows all Sudoku rules:
- No duplicate numbers in any row
- No duplicate numbers in any column
- No duplicate numbers in any 3x3 box

### Web Frontend Implementation

The frontend implements the same recursive backtracking algorithm in JavaScript, making it possible to solve puzzles directly in the browser without needing to compile the assembly code.

## ▶️ How to Use

### Prerequisites

1. NASM (Netwide Assembler) - for assembling the code
2. MinGW-w64 or GCC for Windows - for linking the object files
3. Python 3.x (for the web frontend - comes pre-installed on Windows 11)

### Building and Running the Assembly Version

1. Install the required tools:
   ```cmd
   winget install NASM.NASM
   winget install mingw-w64
   ```

2. Build and run:
   ```cmd
   .\build.bat
   ```

### Running the Web Frontend

**Method 1 - Using Python (Recommended):**
```cmd
.\start_frontend.bat
```
Then open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000

**Method 2 - Using Node.js (Alternative):**
```cmd
.\start_server.bat
```
Then open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000

### Adding Custom Puzzles

1. Edit `puzzles.asm`
2. Add your puzzle data in the same format as existing puzzles
3. Update the main function in `solver.asm` to solve your new puzzle

## 🌐 GitHub Pages Deployment

This project can be deployed to GitHub Pages for online access. Since GitHub Pages serves static files only, the web frontend can run directly in browsers without a server.

To deploy to GitHub Pages:
1. Go to your repository Settings
2. Navigate to Pages section
3. Select "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose the main branch and root folder
5. Save and wait for deployment

Live demo will be available at: https://Vaibhav2422.github.io/Sudoku-Solver/

## 📚 Learning Value

This project demonstrates:
- Low-level programming concepts
- Recursion implementation in assembly
- Memory management and addressing modes
- Algorithm implementation without high-level language constructs
- Windows x64 calling conventions
- Assembly language optimization techniques
- Full-stack development (assembly backend with web frontend)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- **NASM not found**: Ensure NASM is installed and in PATH
- **GCC not found**: Ensure MinGW-w64 is installed and in PATH
- **Assembly errors**: Ensure using NASM 2.14 or later
- **Web server issues**: Ensure Python is installed and port 8000 is available
